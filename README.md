# jekyll-flickr-photoset

It's a Jekyll plugin for embedding Flickr photosets in your Liquid templates.

I was moving from Posterous to Jekyll and I was looking for a slideshow gallery like Posterous had. You put a simple tag with a Flickr photoset ID inside your post and it builds a slideshow gallery. So I made it: one tag generates a gallery, no more. Dead simple.

Here is an example of this integration: [http://blog.wildtrip.net](http://blog.wildtrip.net/)

## Usage

```
{% flickr_photoset 12345678901234567 %}
{% flickr_photoset 12345678901234567 "Square" "Medium 640" "Large" "Site MP4" %}
```

Where:

- `12345678901234567` is the Flickr photoset ID (can be found in this kind of url: `http://www.flickr.com/photos/j0k/sets/72157624158475427/`)
- `"Square"` is the size for the thumbnail image (*which also the one by default*)
- `"Medium 640"` is the size for the displayed image (*which also the one by default*)
- `"Large"` is the size for the opened image (*which also the one by default*)
- `"Site MP4"` is the format for the video in case photoset include a video (*which also the one by default*)

Other Flickr size can be found [here](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.getSizes.html).

## Requirements

#### FlickRaw

*Flickraw is a library to access flickr API in a simple way.*

```
gem install flickraw
```

#### A Flickr API key

You can obtain a Flickr API key [here](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/).
And follow instructions on [the FlickRaw page for authentication](http://hanklords.github.io/flickraw/#label-Authentication):

  - create a `flickr.rb` file with content of "Authentication" bloc code
  - replace `api_key` & `shared_secret` by the one previously generated on the Flickr website
  - launch it with `ruby -rubygems flickr.rb`
  - follow instructions

Then put them inside `_config.yml` (where `flickr:` is defined on the root level):

```yaml
flickr:
  cache_dir:       "./_cache/flickr"
  api_key:          xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  shared_secret:    xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  access_token:     xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  access_secret:    xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Or define them in ENV variables:

 - `FLICKR_API_KEY`
 - `FLICKR_SHARED_SECRET`
 - `FLICKR_ACCESS_TOKEN`
 - `FLICKR_ACCESS_SECRET`

There is also an ability to generate cache. It will put all images references from each photoset. It will save **a lot of time** when you will have to regenerate all your posts. Cache are written in a yml file. Photoset ID is the file name.

#### Rendering

##### [Foundation Clearing](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/clearing.html)

The master branch use Clearing, from Foundation, to display a kind of gallery. It handles a list of images, and a fullscreen slideshow.

##### [AD Gallery](http://adgallery.codeplex.com/)

This is the plugin used to generate the slideshow gallery, which is almost the same from Posterous. You will find references in `adgallery` folder, I put the latest version (1.2.7).

If you want to use it, switch to the [ad-gallery](https://github.com/j0k3r/jekyll-flickr-photoset/tree/ad-gallery) branch. I didn't test it under Jekyll 1.0+.
